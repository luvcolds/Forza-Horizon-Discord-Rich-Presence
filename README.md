## Microsoft Store / Xbox App Users

Windows blocks UWP apps from sending data to local programs. If you play the Microsoft Store version, you need to apply a network fix:
- Click the **Fix Network** button in the app.
- Accept the Administrator prompt to add a Windows Loopback Exemption. 
- You only need to do this **once**.

## Features
